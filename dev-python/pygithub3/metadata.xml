<longdescription lang="en">
	Pygithub3 is a wrapper to the Github API v3, written in Python, and
	has been developed with extensibility in mind, because the API is in
	a beta state, trying to achieve a very loosly coupled set of services.
	It should be very easy to extend to support new requests and resources
	because each of them are managed by themselves.
